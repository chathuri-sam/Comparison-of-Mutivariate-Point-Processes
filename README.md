# Multivariate Log Gaussian Cox Process

Ecological point patterns, encompassing diverse objects like trees and animal presence, are often analyzed using spatial point processes in current studies. However, multivariate spatial point process applications in ecology mostly rely on descriptive methods, limiting their scope.

To address this, the multivariate log Gaussian Cox process is introduced, expanding beyond the traditional bivariate case. This model overcomes the limitations of the Poisson process by capturing the clustered patterns common in tree species. Additionally, the Saturated Pairwise Interaction Gibbs Point Process model is proposed to handle challenges arising from an increasing number of species.

This study thoroughly investigates and compares the performance of the multivariate log Gaussian Cox process and the Saturated Pairwise Interaction Gibbs Process through simulation studies and real data examples. By highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each model, the paper serves as a practical guide for applying these methods in ecological studies.
